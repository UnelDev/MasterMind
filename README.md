# MasterMind Game
MasterMind is a command-line based game built with JavaScript that allows users to play the classic MasterMind game alone against the computer. The game generates a secret combination of colors and the player has to guess the combination. The computer will provide feedback on the player's guesses, indicating which colors are in the right place and which are the right color but in the wrong place.

# Getting Started
To play the game, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository.
- Install the necessary dependencies by running npm i
- Start the game by running node main.js in the command-line. The game will prompt you to enter your combination and provide feedback on your guesses. The authorized colors are "o", "w", "r", "g", "c" and "m".
- You can enter "get" in the command line to get the solution or "exit" to leave the game.
